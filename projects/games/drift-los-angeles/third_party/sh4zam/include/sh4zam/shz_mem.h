/*! \defgroup memory Memory
    \brief    Routines for managing memory.

    This API provides the following types of memory routines:
        - special instruction intrinsics
        - cache operations
        - memcpy()-type routines

    \note
    memcpy()-like routines will typically always check for
    proper alignment and size increments of parameters using
    assert(), so make sure to build a release build (-DNDEBUG)
    for maximal gainz, when not debugging.

/*! Generic drop-in fast memcpy() replacement.

    Copies \p bytes from \p src to \p dst, determining the most efficient
    specialization to call into at run-time, returning \p dst.

    There are no alignment or size requirements for this routine, but it is
    specifically optimized for 2-, 4-, 8-, and 32-byte alignments, with
    bigger alignments bringing bigger gainz.

    \note
    When you know of and can control the \p src and \p dst alignments and
    batch sizes, you can micro-optimize by calling into the most specific
    memcpy() specialization for your given scenario, over just using this
    generic implementation, which must choose which one to use at run-time.

    \warning
    \p dst and \p src buffers should not be overlapping.
