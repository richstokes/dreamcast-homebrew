/*! \file
    \brief   API for operating on MxN matrices within memory.
    \ingroup matrix

    This file provides a collection of routines for manipulating
    MxN matrices which are stored within memory, rather than in
    the XMTRX FP register back-bank.

    Some of these routines are simply loading into the back-bank
    and are performing work there, temporarily. Some of them have
    implementations which have specific optimizations for when the
    matrices are NOT within such registers, which are faster than
    having to go through XMTRX and clobbering the back-bank.

    \todo
        - shz_mat4x4_add_symmetric_skew()
        - shz_mat4x4_add_diagonal()

    \brief    In-Memory Matrix Manipulation

    These types and their corresponding functions are for working
    with matrices stored within memory, as opposed to being preloaded
    within the XMTRX back-bank of FP registers. Typically this is
    desirable for one-off operations where there is no batching of
    matrix operations, especially when clobbering XMTRX is undesirable.

    For most transform types, this API offers 4 different "versions" of
    the operation. Using translation as an example:
        - shz_mat4x4_init_translation(): **Initializes** the the matrix
          to a given transform, setting the other components to identity.
        - shz_mat4x4_set_translation(): **Sets** only the values
          corresponding to the given transform, leaving the others alone.
        - shz_mat4x4_apply_translation(): **Apply** transform operation,
          updates only the values corresponding to the given transform based
          on their current values (additively in this case, multiplicatively
          for scaling and rotation).
        - shz_mat4x4_translate(): **GL-based** transform operation,
          multiplying and accumulating the given matrix by a matrix which
          has been initialized to the given transform.

    \warning
    Beware that some of these routines clobber the matrix currently loaded
    as the active 4x4 matrix, XMTRX.
